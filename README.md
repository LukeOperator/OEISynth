# OEISynth
M4L instrument that generates its oscillator shape by randomly searching the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

If the webpage from the OEIS has too much text, the javascript will fail to parse the sequence into Max.

Most of the sequences create rising sawtooth waves (surprise surprise) but there are many sequences with stepped or bi-directional progress which can create more interesting timbres.
